- 👋 This is the code home of Ipgnosis LLC (https://ipgnosis.com) and, by extension, Russell Bennett.  You can see more about me here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellpbennett
- 👀 I am interested in (almost) anything to do with technology, however my own expertise is related to software.  I have worked on unified communications pretty much from the inception of the technology (c. 2000 CE) including the first 3 versions of Microsoft Lync (now 'Teams').  I have also worked extensively on cloud technology and geographic information systems.
- 🌱 I have invested time in learning how AI *really* works, i.e. not by throwing training data at a cloud service ML package, or parsing text in NLTK or GPT-3; but how, for example, AlphaZero learned how to play Go and Chess (not to mention Starcraft II) from first principles.
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on AI/ML, unified communications, data science, geospatial analysis, cloud technology, autonomous systems.  I am particularly concerned about the growing issue of the abuse of trust in software by state and non-state actors, including, but not limited to: misinformation/'fake news'; spam (emails, voice calls, robocalls, text) and the misrepresentation of identity.
